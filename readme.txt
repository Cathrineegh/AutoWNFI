DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for loss of any personal files or broken installations

This tool should ideally be used when not having booted into windows not through OpenCore.

What's the point of this tool?

I just wanted to make this tool as a way to alter the MacOS EFI files directly from windows, for example in case of a broken installation.

This tool can:
1) Assign and remove driver letters
2) Make it relatively safe to alter your EFI files directly to try out things, as long as you have a backup available in Windows
3) It remembers your choices making it more seamless to use the first or second, third or tenth time



Do I need to use Explorer++ or MiniTool Parition Wizard when I have this?
- No you don't

Does this tool work in other versions of windows than windows 10?
- I have no idea, you can try it

Does this tool work with clover?
- It probably does, I have no idea.
